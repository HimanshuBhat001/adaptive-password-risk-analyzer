# APRA – Technical Overview

The Adaptive Password Risk Analyzer (APRA) evaluates password risk using:

1. Entropy calculation  
2. Human-behavior pattern detection  
3. Leaked-pattern detection  
4. Dictionary weakness detection  
5. Keyboard-sequence recognition  
6. Repetition detection  
7. Brute-force cracking time estimation  

### Why APRA is unique
Unlike a normal strength checker that gives “Weak/Strong”, APRA produces:

- Risk Score (0–100)  
- Risk Category (Low/Medium/High)  
- Attack simulation results  
- Flags for risky characteristics  

This aligns APRA more closely with realistic cybersecurity assessment tools.
